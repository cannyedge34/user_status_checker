# RoR Test

## Objective

Create a `POST /v1/user/check_status` endpoint in a Ruby on Rails API-only application.
This endpoint will perform a series of security checks to determine the ban status of a user.

---

## Request Format

- **Endpoint**: `POST /v1/user/check_status`
- **Content-Type**: `application/json`

### Request Body

```json
{
  "idfa": "8264148c-be95-4b2b-b260-6ee98dd53bf6",
  "rooted_device": false
}
```

---

## Response Format

### Response Body

```json
{
  "ban_status": "not_banned" // or "banned"
}
```

---

## Security Checks

1. **CF-IPCountry Header Whitelisting**
   Ban the user if the `CF-IPCountry` header value is not in the Redis country whitelist.
   > Note: The application is behind a Cloudflare proxy, which passes this header.

2. **Rooted Device Check**
   Ban if `rooted_device` is `true`.

3. **IP Check for Tor/VPN**
   - Ban if the IP is identified as Tor or VPN.
   - Use [VPNAPI](https://vpnapi.io/api-documentation) for this check.
   - Cache the VPNAPI responses in Redis for 24 hours.
   - If the VPNAPI check fails (rate limit, server error), **consider the check as passed**.

## User Record Handling in PostgreSQL

- Create a new user record if `IDFA` does not exist.
- Update the user record if `IDFA` exists.
- If an existing user is already banned, **skip the check chain** and return `"banned"` status.
- Re-run the checks for returning `"not_banned"` users.
- Include the following fields in the `User` model:
  - `idfa`
  - `ban_status` (initial values: `banned`, `not_banned`)
  - `created_at`
  - `updated_at`

---

## Integrity Log Record in PostgreSQL

- Create a log record **when a new user is created** or **an existing userâ€™s `ban_status` changes**.
- Include the following fields in the `IntegrityLog` model:
  - `idfa`
  - `ban_status`
  - `ip`
  - `rooted_device`
  - `country`
  - `proxy`
  - `vpn`
  - `created_at`

---

## Future-Proofing

- Implement a service for the integrity logger to **allow future re-routing of logs to other data sources**.
- Design the `User` model to accommodate **additional `ban_status` values in the future**.

## Technical Stack
- Ruby on Rails 7 (API only)
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- RSpec/FactoryBot for testing

## Testing Requirements
- Provide comprehensive tests using RSpec.
